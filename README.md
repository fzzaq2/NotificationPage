## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Pure HTML5
- jQuery
- CSS3

**Note: These are just examples. Delete this note and replace the list above with your own choices**

### What I learned

There is a lot of new things that I've learnt from this exercise:

```html
<h1>Nothing from html :D</h1>
```
```css
td{
    vertical-align: top;
}
```
```js
let unmarked = $('div .unmarked');
function checkCounter() {
    counter.text($('div .unmarked').length);
}
//from what I had tried, seems like i can't use the global variable of unmarked.
```

### Continued development

I want to keep improving my front-end skills so that i can keep up with future designs.
